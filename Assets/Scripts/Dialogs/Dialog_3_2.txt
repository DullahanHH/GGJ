You are the Demon King of Roots? I vow to you that I will take the crown, and save this world from your evil doings!

The Demon King of Roots, huh. That is what they call me out there nowadays? This brings back memories. Root!
Alas, I vow to you as well that I will not hand this crown to you. Root!
