Haha
Root
Noooooooo, don't give it to him, his real name is the Demon King of Squares! Root!
Square
Hahah, ahahahah, bwahahahahahaha! This power... after so many years I finally felt this power again! Now, to dispose of you...Square!
Root
It's been 50 years, Demon King of Squares, I thought you had died long ago. 
I should have known better, after all there aren't many people alive who knew your real name. 
I assume my being called "Demon King of Roots" was your doing as well? 
All of this just to trick younglings and to satisfy your twisted desires to destroy this world? Root!
Square
You are wrong, foolish hero, not only am I back this time, I will pick up where I left off, and overflow this entire world! 
Square! Square! Square! Square! Ahahahahah I will never get tired of this feeling of destorying anything with the tip of my fingers. Square!
Player
Did I...destory this world...with my very own hands? Was I...being deceived this entire time? Is this the end?
Root
No, youngling, there is still hope, I should have done this 50 years ago. Root!
Player
Don't go! You will disappear forever!
Root
If I don't go, the world will be destroyed regardless and all of use will vanish along with it.
If we don't want to suffer that fate, then I must go, and try my best to save this world, even if it costs me my life. Root!
